# How to Read a Cosmetic Ingredient List

Ever stared at the back of a skincare product and felt overwhelmed by the wall of unpronounceable names? You're not alone. But reading an ingredient list is actually simpler than you think once you know a few key rules.

## The Concentration Rule

By law, cosmetic ingredients must be listed in **descending order of concentration**. The first ingredient is present in the highest amount, and the last is present in the smallest amount.

- **First 5 ingredients** = the bulk of the formula (often 70-80%)
- **Ingredients below 1%** can be listed in any order
- **Water (Aqua)** is almost always first in water-based products

## What to Look For

### Active Ingredients
These are the ingredients that actually "do something" for your skin. Look for them in the **first half** of the list for meaningful concentrations:
- **Niacinamide** — oil control, brightening
- **Retinol** — anti-aging
- **Salicylic Acid** — acne treatment
- **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)** — antioxidant, brightening

### Red Flags
Not necessarily bad, but worth paying attention to:
- **Fragrance/Parfum** near the top — high concentration of fragrance
- **Alcohol Denat.** in the first few ingredients — can be drying
- **Multiple irritants** clustered together

## The 1% Line

Many cosmetic chemists note that preservatives like **phenoxyethanol** (typically used at 0.5-1%) can serve as a rough marker. Ingredients listed after it are likely present at less than 1%.

## Practice Makes Perfect

The more ingredient lists you read, the better you'll get at spotting patterns. Use CosmeticLens to analyze products and build your ingredient literacy over time!
