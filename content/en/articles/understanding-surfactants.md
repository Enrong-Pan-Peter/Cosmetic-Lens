# Understanding Surfactants: Why Your Cleanser Foams

Surfactants are the ingredients that make your cleanser foam, lather, and actually clean your skin. But not all surfactants are created equal—some are gentle, while others can strip your skin barrier.

## What Are Surfactants?

Surfactants (surface-active agents) have a unique molecular structure: one end attracts water, the other attracts oil. This allows them to grab onto dirt, oil, and makeup and wash them away with water.

## Types of Surfactants

### Harsh Surfactants
- **Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)** — very effective cleanser but can irritate sensitive skin
- **Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)** — slightly gentler cousin of SLS, still strong

### Gentle Surfactants
- **Cocamidopropyl Betaine** — derived from coconut oil, very mild
- **Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate** — the surfactant in Dove bars, extremely gentle
- **Decyl Glucoside** — plant-derived, suitable for babies and sensitive skin

### Amino Acid Surfactants
These are the gold standard for gentle cleansing:
- **Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate**
- **Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate**
- **Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate**

## More Foam ≠ Better Clean

One of the biggest skincare myths is that more foam means a better clean. In reality, foam is just air trapped in surfactant molecules. Gentle, low-foam cleansers can clean just as effectively as foamy ones—without stripping your skin.

## Choosing the Right Cleanser

- **Oily skin**: Can tolerate slightly stronger surfactants
- **Dry/sensitive skin**: Stick to amino acid or gentle surfactants
- **Everyone**: Avoid cleansers that leave your skin feeling "squeaky clean"—that tightness means your barrier has been disrupted
